# Universal Blind Quantum Computation

This directory contains a client/server example of UBQC which is built on top of MBQC (measurement based quantum computation).


## MBQC

Interpret Flow notations MBQC as follows. There are four kinds of outputs:

* E [i,j]: entangle qubits i and j using Controlled Phase. 
* M i <img src="./docs/svgs/f50853d41be7d55874e952eb0d80c53e.svg" align=middle width=9.794565000000006pt height=22.831379999999992pt/> [m] [n]: Measurement angle for qubit i is <img src="./docs/svgs/5fc34debe9fe8c2254296f70d46bf923.svg" align=middle width=178.268805pt height=29.19113999999999pt/>
* X j i: Operation of conditional X on qubit j depending on measurement outcome of qubit i
* Z j i: Operation of conditional Z on qubit j depending on measurement outcome of qubit i
* X's and Z's can be accommodated in mesurement angle as such: <img src="./docs/svgs/17de0d63787245126004f04d9b080bea.svg" align=middle width=67.31604pt height=27.91271999999999pt/>: Measurement angle of qubit <img src="./docs/svgs/3369485e5fd1f281f6f6a547fa661280.svg" align=middle width=132.07309499999997pt height=24.65759999999998pt/>, where <img src="./docs/svgs/4fa3ac8fe93c68be3fe7ab53bdeb2efa.svg" align=middle width=12.356520000000005pt height=14.155350000000013pt/>, <img src="./docs/svgs/59efeb0f4f5d484a9b8a404d5bdac544.svg" align=middle width=14.971605000000004pt height=14.155350000000013pt/> are the measurement outcomes of qubits i and k respectively.


## Running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cgmcintyr/SimulaQron.git
cd SimulaQron
git checkout develop
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH
export NETSIM=$(pwd)
./run/startAll.sh
cd examples/mbqc/
python sever.py &
python client.py
```


## Client/Server

### Client Design

The client will load a random circuit from the `circuits` directory. This circuit describes a computation the client wishes to perform.

Firstly the client converts the circuit into their measurement equivalents (see `measurements.py`), then converts these measurements into an MBQC flow that can be sent to the server (see `flow.py`).

The client then communicates with the server.

1. The client requests the server to reserve the number of qubits required for the measurements.
2. The client sends the entanglements for the server to perform on the reserved qubits.
3. The client sends one measurement at a time, randomly adding an adjustment to the angle of measurement. The client will make adjustments to their output to undo the random angle adjustments. This is done to ensure the server can never be sure what angle the client is truly interested in.
4. The client prints the output of it's computation.

### Server Design

The server was designed to accomodate the client, please see above.

The server can only handle one client at a time, and shuts itself down after a single UBQC has been completed.


## Circuit JSON Documentation

We describe circuits to be encoded into MBQC format using a JSON file (see
examples in the `circuits` directory).


### Top Level Object

The file contains a single JSON object:

| Key   | Type                             | Descrption                    |
|-------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| gates | list of gate objects (see below) | contains list of gate objects |


### Gate Objects

| Key    | Type                    | Descrption                                                                     |
|--------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name   | string                  | name of gate to be created (does not have to be unique)                        |
| type   | string                  | "H", "CZ", "CX", "Z", or "X" (no other gates supported)                        |
| qubits | list of strings or ints | lists qubits the gate is applied to (2nd qubit is not necessary for H, X or Z) |
